              In the initial conceptualization of my project, I was looking for the escape routes out of Modernism without falling into some of the dead-end traps of post-modernism.  Like the Monolith in 2001: A Space Odyssey, the form signifies a trigger-able event. It aims at a reversal of Modernism, or at the very least one constructed by variable loops. One that looks back at itself and comprehends its shape. The ape now looks at the Monolith and recognizes its own reflection. “I know what I am, and I like what I see!” the ape thinks.  It — the form — is in observing, unveiling and/or discovering these sets of relationships where art might exist. The Monolith re/presents a key to unlocking the evolutionary consciousness of the mind — thought itself. This is the way the project began. The geometric form, the building block, Fröbel’s Gifts, present a point of departure, of processing experience through that metaphorical/metonymical relationship. This is where my project began.

             Looking at a grid of the past provides an interesting point of view for the shifting present/future. The eventual erosion of this view shows new formations just beneath the smoothed surface. I look into the past and can see the present differently. How will I see it tomorrow? What does this type of ahistorical observation mean? Take Smithson’s example of playing a film of an event forward as a record of the event, then backward as a reversal of the event. He posits that the film will eventually fold and enter a state of irreversibility. But things don’t run that way anymore. Digitization has once again shifted that type of entropy into a simulation of what once was. Now there is no one set way to look at anything. Rather new perspectives and reaction to those perspectives.
